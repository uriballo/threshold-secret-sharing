# Shamir's Threshold Secret Sharing Web App

Implementation of the [STSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shamir%27s_Secret_Sharing) workflow using react and the [secrets.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/secrets.js-34r7h/v/2.0.0) library.

The app has two *modes*: split and build. The former is used to split a secret (text) into pieces and the former for reconstructing the secret.

TODO: Improve UX by downloading pieces in .txt and improving the reconstructed secret UI.
